# Survey-app

This project is inspired by a YouTube video tutorial by [The codeholic](https://youtu.be/bHRe5XNP5l8). The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/thecodeholic/laravel-react-survey).

## About

I've built upon the foundation of the original project and introduced several enhancements and new features:

### Backend (Laravel)

- Implemented Laravel Passport and Socialite for authentication and authorization.
- Integrated Google and GitHub OAuth2.0 for seamless third-party authentication.
- Implemented email verification using queued events sent out after user registration.
- Implemented email notification using queued events to notify survey owners of new answers to survey.
- Utilized Amazon S3 storage for efficient handling of user profile picture uploads.
- Enhanced user experience with features to edit user profiles.
- Implemented modularized entities in which i splited surveys, questions, and answers into distinct entities, each with its own API resources and routes for better organization and maintainability.
- I implemented the repository software development pattern to handle data operations for each model entity. This enhances code separation and allows for easier testing and extensibility.
- I Utilized Laravel's built-in database transactions to manage multiple database activities as a single unit. This ensures data consistency and rollback on failure.
- I developed custom exception classes to handle exceptions consistently throughout the application. This provides more informative error messages and a better user experience.
- Implemented policies for controller handlers.

### Frontend (React)

- On the frontend, I used React TypeScript along with useReducers and useContext for more organized state management.
- Replaced useState with useReducers for better state management.
- Improved user experience with skeleton loaders and lazy loading of content.
- Better error handling UI accross the application
- Enhanced the application by persisting the answer data options when a diffrent option is selected
- Implemented User profile page
- Implemented survey view alongsides their questions and answer
